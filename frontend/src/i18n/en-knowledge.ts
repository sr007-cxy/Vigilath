GEO focuses on making your brand visible and citable by AI engines. AEO takes it further — optimizing your content so AI not only finds you but directly understands, trusts, and selects your brand as the best answer to user questions. While traditional SEO optimizes for blue links on search result pages, GEO + AEO optimizes the actual answers AI generates.",
