"""Module-level mutable state: scores dict, page cache, fix flag.

Migrated from /geo_checker.py lines 27 (SHOW_FIX), 125 (_page_cache),
148-188 (_scores / track_score / get_ai_visibility_score / get_grade /
reset_state).

Originally these globals were single-threaded (upstream CLI design), which is
why backend/geo/services/geo_checker.py has `_geo_checker_lock` around the
entire request. With issue #14 (top-level generate_score concurrency), we now
need the 25 check_* to run in parallel WITHIN a single request — so the two
mutable globals below carry their own locks:

  - `_scores_lock`        — serializes `track_score` updates
  - `_page_cache_lock`    — serializes dict read/write in io.fetch

`SHOW_FIX` is a read-mostly flag toggled once per request (before parallel
check execution begins), so it doesn't need locking.

A future P2 refactor will migrate these to contextvars / explicit parameters
to remove the locks entirely.
